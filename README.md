# vacdec
Python script to decode the EU Covid-19 vaccine certificate, as [specified by the EU](https://ec.europa.eu/health/ehealth/covid-19_en).

This script takes an image with a QR code of a vaccine certificate as
the parameter and will show the certificate's content. It will not
validate the signature.

The code is very short and should provide an easy way to understand
how these certificates are encoded:

* The QR code encodes a string starting with "HC1:".
* The string following "HC1:" is base45 encoded.
* Decoding the base45 leads to zlib-compressed data.
* Decompression leads to a CBOR Web Token structure.

## setup

You will need the python pillow, pyzbar, cbor2 and base45 packages.
You can install them via your distribution or via pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## usage

Run:

```
./vacdec [image]
```

[image] can be an image in any format pillow supports, including of
course PNG and JPG.
